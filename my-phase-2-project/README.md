# Georgia Wildlife

### Summary

This app was built for my 3-year-old son who loves animals. Instead of showcasing his favorite animals from all over the world, I wanted him to explore the animals in his own backyard.

This app pulls from a JSON server to display the animals, each of which has an animal card and button, clicking on which displays its name in Spanish. It uses client-side routes to navigate between Home, Animals, Threatened (animals) and Add Animal where the user can submit a new animal to the database.

### Installation

To install from the GIT server, type the following into your terminal: git@github.com:wwchesson/georgia-wildlife-phase-2-project.git
Don't forget to run the JSON server in order to load the data onto the page.

### Files

There are nine components in the components folder under src, one of which consists of styling elements using StyledComponents. In the json-server folder, you can find the db.json file.

### Additional Information

Information for animals and threatened status was primarily taken from:
https://www.inaturalist.org/places/georgia#taxon=1
